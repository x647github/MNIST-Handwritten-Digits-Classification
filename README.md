# MNIST Handwritten Digits Classification using TensorFlow

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits (0 - 9) that contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. Each digit is stored in a grayscale image with a size of 28 x 28 pixels. 

This project built a simple neural network with one hidden layer to classify handwritten digits.
